<p>Today as I'm pondering copyright and access a recent work issue is stirring my mind more than anything that I've read. How can you limit access to university created content in a way that encourages user to continue paying for that content. This is some what important to for smaller journals and publishing groups that are attempting to be self sufficient. These journals and groups have put a lot of effort into their intellectual creations, don't they deserve the "profits" of their labor. Should they be denied because their labor is housed at an academic institution? Should it be owned by the institution, the state, the public? These are difficult to answer questions that epitomize the tension between creators and consumer of information. Instinct makes me want to release information freely into the electronic wilds, but why should there not be some controls to help smaller groups find necessary funding to be able to create such good works.</p>
