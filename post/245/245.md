<p>While I may enjoy this quietness of this time of the year, there's still a lot of work to be done. Between evaluations, winding down projects, and planning for next semester, I find myself really busy.</p>
<p>Here are some of my big semester plans</p>
<p>    expand my research process flow chart into a formal presentation<br />
    complete and O'connor research guide<br />
    aggressively promote liaison work and university archives<br />
    digital archiving<br />
    much more</p>
