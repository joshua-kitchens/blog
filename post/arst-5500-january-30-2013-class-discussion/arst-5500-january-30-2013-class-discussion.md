<p>Questions</p>
<p>    Two articles discuss Jenkinson's four characteristics of archives (impartiality, authenticity, naturalness, interrelationship of records). Do like these characteristics? What was the core disagreement between Duranti and Boles/Greene over these?<br />
    In selection of records, who is more important to consider the records creator or the research that might use them? (Tshan)<br />
    What are your thoughts on Duranti's vision of archival theory? (Duranti, 342-343)<br />
    Did you think that Duranti fairly assessed the pricinples of both Jenkinson and Schellenberg? Do you think Boles and Greene fairly assess the argument of Duranti?<br />
    Boles and Greene call the archvial profession an applied profession. Is archives an applied discipline? Is utility of records the most important idea?<br />
    Is it wise to be judicial in pruning? (Boles)<br />
    Are we the keepers of the Orwellian Memory Hole(Samuels quotes Orwell in her opening)? What is the power of this memory hole? (Samuels)<br />
    Do you think that a documentation strategy as defined by Samuels is an effective method for collection archival records? (Samuels)<br />
    Samuels emphasizes collaboration among archives to ensure topics are documented completely. Is this something that we can do? What might inhibit archives from collaborating with one another? (Samuels)</p>
