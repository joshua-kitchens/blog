<p>This is a great editorial that was written before the current Georgia College Library came into existence. What I find fascinating about this student's argument for a library centered around how important a library collection is to attracting students to a campus and to make sure that the college's reputation. These two ideas are central to how we advocate for libraries today. I also found it funny that the student is begging for works of fiction to read, which is a request we hear a lot at Georgia College. Though I'm going to disagree about those dime editions. They are some kind of wonderful.</p>
