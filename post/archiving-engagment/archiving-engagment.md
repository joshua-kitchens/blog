<p>Here's a post from Georgia College's ENGAGE program about the presentation I recent did with Katie Simon and Tess Lyle about the Citizen Solider Project @ Georgia College  blog.</p>

<p>This project involved working with freshmen student, artist Jack Leamy, Katie, Tess (a TA), community groups, and most of the library's departments.</p>
