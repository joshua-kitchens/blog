<p> Thisngs are rarely easy in the wide world of archiving. I've learned that I should always expected the unexpected, but It never fails that I'll be surprised by something. This morning's pick-up was no exception. I was faced with the flooding to the left upon first arriving at the vault I was to clean out this morning. Thankfully with generous help from our moving crew, we were able to move all the materials out with out anyone getting really soaked. My shoes did get a bit squish, and I think I inhaled my weekly allotment of dust and rat droppings, but all and all, it could have been worse.</p>
